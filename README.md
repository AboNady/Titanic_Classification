    The Titanic classification problem is widely known for beginners, so I used my basic knowledge to answer the question "Will you survive?".

## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Version 3.10

* **Scikit-Learn**: Version 1.1.2

* **Pandas**: Version 1.4.3


## Details

* Feature engineering was the best thing I learned in this project; I dropped the nan columns because they were misleading for the classification algorithm. Then I replaced the nan values with the coulmn's mean.


* I splitted the dataset to 70% Train and 30% Test.

* I tried eight different classifican algorithms and the results was as following:

LogisticRegression score is :  84.7
-----------
DecisionTreeClassifier Score is :  80.6%
-----------
KNeighborsClassifier Score is :  74.63%
-----------
GaussianNB Score is :  79.1%
-----------
SVC Score is :  67.54%
-----------
Perceptron Score is :  76.49%
-----------
SGDClassifier Score is :  81.34%
-----------
RandomForestClassifier Score is :  78.73%
-----------
