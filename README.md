    k-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that seeks to segment a dataset into groups based on the similarity of datapoints. An unsupervised model has independent variables and no dependent variables. In this project, I break down the basic idea of it, just simple to understand how it works.

## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Version 3.10

* **Scikit-Learn**: Version 1.1.2

* **Pandas**: Version 1.4.3


## Details

* Feature Engineering was the best thing I learned in this project, I droped the nan columns becuase it was misleading for the classification algorithm. Then, I replaced the possible nan values with the mean of its coulmn. 


* I splitted the dataset to 70% Train and 30% Test

* I tried eight different classifican algorithms and the results was as following:

LogisticRegression score is :  84.7
-----------
DecisionTreeClassifier Score is :  80.6%
-----------
KNeighborsClassifier Score is :  74.63%
-----------
GaussianNB Score is :  79.1%
-----------
SVC Score is :  67.54%
-----------
Perceptron Score is :  76.49%
-----------
SGDClassifier Score is :  81.34%
-----------
RandomForestClassifier Score is :  78.73%
